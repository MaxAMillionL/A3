What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?

It was super helpful in figruing out memory allocation. I think the
difficulty may be exaggerated as this is just a busy time of the
semester. It was really fun and easy using Stack as a reference.
I think that the challenge portion should have a little more 
instruction. I wasn't sure wether to rehash everything or not but I 
ended up figuring it out. I worked like 10 hours on the assignment and 
that ended up being 5 of them.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?



------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on symtablelist.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write
"None."

None

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on symtablelist.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

It asks if I want to assert pvValue or pvExtra, which I do not because
they are allowed to be NULL.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on symtablehash.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write
"None."

None

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on symtablehash.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

It has the same warnings as the list implementation, which I do not
agree with because these values are allowed to be NULL.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What are the CPU times reported by testsymtable.c with binding counts
50, 500, 5000, 50000, and 500000 using (1) your linked list
implementation, (2) your non-expanding hash table implementation, and
(3) your expanding hash table implementation? Fill in the blanks.

The linked list implementation with:
-- 50 bindings consumed 0.000000 seconds.
-- 500 bindings consumed 0.000503 seconds.
-- 5000 bindings consumed 0.371505 seconds.
-- 50000 bindings consumed 38.762649 seconds.
-- 500000 bindings consumed more than 5 minutes.

The non-expanding hash table implementation with:
-- 50 bindings consumed 0.000000 seconds.
-- 500 bindings consumed 0.000000 seconds.
-- 5000 bindings consumed 0.024842 seconds.
-- 50000 bindings consumed 0.429074 seconds.
-- 500000 bindings consumed 78.061415 seconds.

The expanding hash table implementation with:
-- 50 bindings consumed 0.000000 seconds.
-- 500 bindings consumed 0.000000 seconds.
-- 5000 bindings consumed 0.014311 seconds.
-- 50000 bindings consumed 0.151555 seconds.
-- 500000 bindings consumed 1.875053 seconds.
